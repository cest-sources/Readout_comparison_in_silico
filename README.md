# In silico Readout comparison  for CEST MRI
An often-discussed question in CEST MRI is the question about the best readout. To make a fair comparison we want to revisit this problem once again in a controlled simulation framework. We focus herein on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), acquisition time (TA) and the width of the point spread function (Î“) and compare FLASH, TSE, and bSSFP for the exact same digital twin of a human brain. 

Open the Jupyter notebook directly in colab to reproduce our results.
